cookbook for using command-line tools to do everyday tasks.\nIn your daily work, you often encounter various types of repetitive manual tasks, such as renaming a lot of files, finding texts, processing texts and so on. These tasks take a lot of time doing manually using GUI. This book aims to leverage the power of the command line tools to make your job less tedious and more enjoyable.\nThis book presents \"recipes\" for preparing or accomplishing specific tasks. Each recipe contains a \"Problem\" statement and a \"Solution\" section. The solution section lists one or several best ways to accomplish the task that the author knows of.\nSince I want to focus on having at least one workable solution that you can just copy and paste, not on teaching Bash by examples, there will not be a lot of detailed explanations about what each command does. Readers are encouraged to do extensive research about particular commands or patterns they are interested in. By doing that, they will discover even much more usages in situations they may not think of at the moment. Doing so, however, will require more time which normally we don't have. This is the practical reason why I chose this approach.\nThe recipes are ordered randomly. All commands should be applicable on most Linux distros, MacOS (there might be some missing default commands you might have to install using HomeBrew). On Windows, you have to install Cygwin or something similar. On some occasions, I use external tools from Python, Perl or Nodejs community since they're super easy to install and use, just like your default Linux or GNU commands.\nThis book is always a work in progress.\n\nread online at:\n\nhttp://minhhh.github.io/cli-cookbook/\n\ncontribute content, suggestions, and fixes on github:\n\nhttps://github.com/minhhh/cli-cookbook\n\nReferences\n\nThe Linux Cookbook\nCommandline fu\n\n"},"the-shell.html":{"url":"the-shell.html","title":"The shell","keywords":"","body":"This chapter focus on using the shell to run and/or coordinate different programs together.

For instance, change all the file names. For simple task like just changing the extension, you can do mv *.png *.jpg. But what if you want to replace spaces in the file name with - or _. Or maybe you want to add a hash to the file name. Things are a little bit more complicated.\nSolution\nThe universal solution to all of these problems is xargs. Basically, you can print all of the items that you need to do something with and pass it to xargs to process them one by one.\nThe way to do this is:\n    ...previous command | xargs -n 1 command\nThe -n 1 part is to ensure that you process the list one at a time. This only work if the previous command doesn't generate string with newline and spaces. If it does then we have to specify another character as delimiter by xargs, usually the null character \\0. With the find command we can use option -print0.\nLet's try to add an extra extension to all our files in a folder\n    find . ! -path . -print0 | xargs -n 1 -0 -I {} sh -c 'mv \"{}\" \"{}.extra\"'\nThe find . ! -path . -print0 part find all files and folder, excluding current dir .. Then xargs take each of the name as {}, and execute move command sh -c 'mv \"{}\" \"{}.extra\"' to them.\nLet's see how can we replace all spaces in all filenames in a folder with -.\n    find . ! -path . | awk '{ str=$0; gsub(\" \", \"-\", str); print \"mv \\\"\"$0\"\\\" \\\"\"str\"\\\"\" \"\\0\"; }' | xargs -n 3 -0 -I {} sh -c '{}'\nThis time we have to do a little more quoting so that we can deal with filenames with space. Basically we generate a string of the command we want to run using awk. Then we pass the whole command string to xargs and run it.\nIt's worth knowing that we can also do this directly with awk\n    .... previous command | awk '{system(\"command \\\"\"$0\"\\\"\")}'\nSo the previous command becomes\n    find . ! -path . | awk '{ str=$0; gsub(\" \", \"-\", str); system(\"mv \\\"\"$0\"\\\" \\\"\"str\"\\\"\" \"\\0\"); }'\nIn this case using awk is simpler. However when you have to process several parameters/lines at a time, xargs proves to be more straight forward.\n"},"generating-random-numbers.html":{"url":"generating-random-numbers.html","title":"Generating random numbers","keywords":"","body":"Generating random numbers\nProblem\nYou want to generate a random number.

In this case, we can pipe the result of rsync to another program called pv.

First we use temporary variables to store the source and the destination folders. Then we count how many items are there in the source folder. Then we use rsync to copy files one by one and print them out. pv will pick up the number of lines and use that with the total number of items to calculate the complete percentage.\nNote that if you want to copy a folder inside another folder then you should not include / in , for instance, set it to MyFolder.

You also want to find files that are bigger/smaller than X bytes\nSolution\nFind the largest file/folder non-recursively OR sort files and folders by size\n    ls -A | awk '{system(\"du -sh \\\"\"$0\"\\\"\")}'| sort -hr | head\nFind the largest file in a folder and all subfolders recursively\n    find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -n 1 du -sh | sort -hr | head\n\n    # on Macos\n    find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -n 1 du -sm | sort -nr | head\n\n    # display in block of 1024-byte\n    find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -n 1 du -sk | sort -nr | head\n\n    # display in block of 1-Mbyte\n    find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -n 1 du -sm | sort -nr | head\nThis command use find to search for all file recursively. The option -print0 removes the need for sed to escape spaces since all fields now are separated by null character. args -0 makes sure we use null separator.\nTo find files smaller/larger than X bytes we will also use find command with the -size option\n    // find files larger than 4096 bytes\n    find . -type f -size +4096c\n\n    // find files smaller than 1M\n    find . -type f -size -1M\nOptions for the -size switch\n    -size n[ckMGTP]\n        True if the file's size, rounded up, in 512-byte blocks is n.  If n is followed by a c, then the primary is true if the\n        file's size is n bytes (characters).  Similarly if n is followed by a scale indicator then the file's size is compared to n\n        scaled as:\n\n        k       kilobytes (1024 bytes)\n        M       megabytes (1024 kilobytes)\n        G       gigabytes (1024 megabytes)\n        T       terabytes (1024 gigabytes)\n        P       petabytes (1024 terabytes)\n"},"finding-files-in-a-folder.html":{"url":"finding-files-in-a-folder.html","title":"Finding files in a folder","keywords":"","body":"Finding files in a folder\nProblem\nYou want to find a file by name in a folder, but also want to exclude certain folder in the find path.
