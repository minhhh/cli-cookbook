A cookbook for using command-line tools to do everyday tasks.

In your daily work, you often encounter various types of repetitive manual tasks, such as renaming a lot of files, finding texts, processing texts and so on. These tasks take a lot of time doing manually using GUI. This book aims to leverage the power of the command line tools to make your job less tedious and more enjoyable.

This book presents "recipes" for preparing or accomplishing specific tasks. Each recipe contains a "Problem" statement and a "Solution" section. The solution section lists one or several best ways to accomplish the task that the author knows of.

Since I want to focus on having at least one workable solution that you can just copy and paste, not on teaching Bash by examples, there will not be a lot of detailed explanations about what each command does. Readers are encouraged to do extensive research about particular commands or patterns they are interested in. By doing that, they will discover even much more usages in situations they may not think of at the moment. Doing so, however, will require more time which normally we don't have. This is the practical reason why I chose this approach.

The recipes are ordered randomly. All commands should be applicable on most Linux distros, MacOS (there might be some missing default commands you might have to install using HomeBrew). On Windows, you have to install `Cygwin` or something similar. On some occasions, I use external tools from Python, Perl or Nodejs community since they're super easy to install and use, just like your default Linux or GNU commands.

This book is always a work in progress.
